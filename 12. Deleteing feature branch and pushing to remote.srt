1
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:04,980
Okay.

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:11,150
We have successfully completed the rebasing process and now we have actually merged all means that were

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,860
made and feature on branch into master branch.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,750
And now we can safely delete future one branch.

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:24,330
Let me clear terminal and enter command get branch does redeem feature 1 enter and branch feature 1

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:30,300
was deleted and at the moment we have only a single branch master and no one will step left.

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,540
Let's push our changes to a remote repository.

8
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:40,620
Yet Bush does review and I'm pushing too remote resolving deltas and changes were successfully pushed

9
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:47,370
a remote repository and file and or get a log amount now you'll see that the local repository and remote

10
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:54,630
repository are fully synchronized and local master branch and remote master branch point to the same

11
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:01,290
commit and actually does at last commit made in feature one branch and if I'll go back now to remote

12
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:07,820
repository here it is and refresh page here you'll see that there are six communes in this repository

13
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,410
and again history is linear near every committee has only a single parent.

14
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:19,710
That's how rebasing works in action and please use it carefully because again main point is that rebasing

15
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:26,760
rewrites history it creates brand new means and previous comments made in future branches are actually

16
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,360
lost.

17
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,370
They are garbage collected.

18
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:34,830
This is all about probation and in the next section we will discuss how to ignore some files that you

19
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,330
don't want to commit.

20
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,680
I'll see you in the next section.

21
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,050
Bye bye.
